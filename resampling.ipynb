    "The choice between these two is arbitrary; and in Python, it'll actually give you the first one of the ones encountered if there are two equal values; and this is really handy. Part of the design concept for our counter was it was modelled on smalltalk bags; and the notion of a bag was you can put 50 marblesinto a bag, red marbles and then put another 50 green marbles and another 10 yellow marbles and then the bag would let you take these out one at a time. So it worked like any other container except that it was quite efficient in the way it stored. Instead of putting all of the marbles in seperately, it listed them in as just one time along with their count. In C++ this is called a multiset. So one of the notions of the bag is since there were a lot of marbles in there, you can pull them all out one at a time. The tool for doing that for us is called elements.\n",

    "Another one that people often forget is ```lambda```. Lambda used to be very popular in the Python world. People used to use ```map``` and ```lambda``` quite a bit, but then list comprehensions came along; and list comprehensions are so much more beautiful, most of the time, that people started to forget about lambda or they decided that lambda was unattractive. Python has grown a lot of tools to try to make up for people trying to not use lambda. So we used to use lambda for everything; but now we have partial objects, we have item getters, attribute getters, and a whole zoo of other objects whose sole purpose is to make sure that you don't have to use a lambda. I say just get over it and learn to use lambda. Why is it so many people react badly to lambda? I think because of the name.

So this is a step toward reproducible research always using a random seed so that we can reproduce your sequence and know that you didn't cherry pick the results.

    "In fact, all of these functions are quite related to each other. That said, you rarely want to use this style and would instead prefer saying shuffle to shuffle and choice for a single choice; and then the interesting one is choices itself, which allows sampling with replacement. So I hope you enjoyed that little tour of Python. Some of this might've seemed basic to some of you; some of you might've thought that some parts were new. I think your favorite part is going to be f-strings. That said, these represent the core tools that we use in data analytics. So very soon, in our next lesson, we're about to go put all of these things together and see how they can be used for data analytics. I think you're going to see that even though the tools are simple, they can be combined together to express big ideas. Remember, the theme of our overall presentation here is a lot of people write way too much code. They take way too many lines to express their ideas; and in doing so, the ideas become muddy, the code becomes hard to change, and it doesn't become very expressive. What I'd like to teach you is to write Python and enjoy it the way I do, to express big ideas with only a little amount of code. And so what's coming up next is resampling statistics. Don't let the statistics part scare you off. It's going to be very approachable, and we're going to be able to do things that will be easy for us that are hard for other people, in part, because they're using statistics the way they were taught in school. Resampling statistics is fun, it's easy, it takes very little code, and we've now laid all of the groundwork for it."
